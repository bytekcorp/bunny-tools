# AGENTS.md — bunny-tools

Bunny.net CLI — storage deploy, CDN purge, full resource management.

**Binary:** `bunny`  |  **Version:** 0.1.0-rc.8  |  **Active commands:** 48/48

<!-- HANDCURATED:START -->

## Quickstart for AI agents

When asked to deploy a project to Bunny.net using bunny-tools:

1. Check that `bunny.json` exists in the project root. If not, run `bunny init`.
2. Check global creds with `bunny auth list`. If empty, `bunny init` will prompt for them (interactive) or run `bunny init --non-interactive --features=storage --account-key=... --storage-zone=... --storage-password=...` (CI).
3. Run `bunny deploy --dry-run` first to verify the plan.
4. Run `bunny deploy` to sync storage and purge CDN cache.

## Common workflows

- **Deploy a static site**: `bunny deploy`
- **Purge CDN cache only**: `bunny purge tag:<name>` or `bunny purge pull-zone:<id>`
- **List storage zones**: `bunny storage-zone:list --json`
- **Manage DNS records**: `bunny dns:record:list <zone>` then `bunny dns:record:add ...`

## Gotchas

- Bunny has 4 distinct credential types (account, storage zone, stream library, database). All use the `AccessKey` HTTP header but with different scopes.
- Storage uses 8 regional endpoints; bunny-tools resolves the region per zone automatically.
- Pagination: bunny-tools always uses `page=1, perPage=1000` to avoid Bunny’s `page=0` array footgun.
- Per-folder storage cap: keep <10000 files per directory.
- Tag-based purge requires the origin to set a `Cache-Tag` response header. Without it, fall back to `purge: "all"`.

## MCP usage

`bunny mcp` boots an MCP stdio server (Phase 6). Install for Claude Code with:

```bash
claude mcp add bunny-tools npx -y bunny-tools mcp
```
